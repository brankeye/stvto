    <Typography type={'title'}>The Ving Tsun System</Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      Ving Tsun is a dense little system that focuses on efficient use of body
      mechanics and energy while promoting what we view as the five essential
      attributes: Balance, Timing, Coordination, Relaxation and Sensitivity.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      The system breaks down into 3 hand forms two weapon and the famous "Wooden
      Man" form.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      Each piece of the system lays the foundation for the next. You cannot
      separate or dissect it. Thinking "oh the wooden dummy looks cool" or
      "those swords look fierce." and learning only that piece without the
      context the system provides will leave you only "wearing the model's
      clothes."
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      We don't promote memorization of techniques and principles. We use
      repetition to re-tune your reflexes. The system is simple and easily
      digestible. It is laid out methodically with each step laying the
      foundation for the next.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      Here is how the system breaks down (high level view)
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'title'}>Hand forms</Typography>
    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>Siu Lim Tao</Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      The first of the three hand forms, Siu Lim Tao is dense and fascinating.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      Essentially it's broken down into three parts. It initially assumes you
      know nothing and patiently explains the basic vocabulary of the system.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      The first section is centered on using your body to show you correct
      positions and structure. The second how to generate power in various
      directions and lastly putting them together properly.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      The lessons are given to you methodically; first you learn proper stance,
      how to “draw your centerline”, how to punch, make a fist and so on.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      As you progress through the system you will come to see this form in many
      different lights.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>Chum Kiu "Searching the Bridge"</Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      One cannot understand the nature of Chum Kiu without first learning the
      basics offered in Siu Lim Tao.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      Once you have learn those basics from a stationary position it is time to
      apply them while moving and interacting with another person.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      The focus here is on finding the "connection point" or bridge between you
      and your target, to do so offensively while maintaining defensive
      advantages.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>Biu Jee "Shooting Fingers"</Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      In my experience this is the most misunderstood form in the system. Some
      believe it contains movements so dangerous that to use them would
      instantly kill your opponent and their whole family ;).
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      This is not how we view this form. Once again understanding a form in Ving
      Tsun you must take the others into account.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      In Siu Lim Tao you have learn proper position, structure, how to throw
      power and technique. Then you learn in Chum Kiu how to do this while
      moving and dealing with another person. What’s left? We should be done
      right? Not quite.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      The question now becomes, what happens when things go wrong? When you lose
      position, misstep or have your “structure” compromised. Essentially Biu
      Jee covers the "Emergency Techniques” used to recapture what we would call
      optimal position. This form concludes the three hand forms.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'title'}>Weapon Forms</Typography>
    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>
      Luk Dim Poon Kwan "6 1/2 Point Pole
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'quote'}>
      “Luk Dim Poon Kwan, like other elements of Ving Tsun, needs to be studied
      completely and for its own sake, not as a means to some other end.”
      <br />– Grandmaster Moy Yat
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      The 6 1/2 Point Pole refers to the number of techniques in the form. This
      form is used to train power, horse, centreline and provide a deeper view
      of the systems principles.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>Pah Chum Dao "8 Slicing Knives"</Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      The Bah Cham Dao are two short broad-bladed swords. Generally not part of
      the official curriculum, this form was traditionally withheld from
      students at the Sifu's discretion.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      The repetitions in this form are counted at 4 instead of the customary 3.
      This reminds us that the movements in the Bah Chum Dao deal death with
      every movement. The number 4 in Chinese Culture is synonymous with death.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      Bah Cham Dao is used these days to train punching power, "fierceness" and
      footwork.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      Formal teaching of this form is not officially part of the system. When
      you are "ready" you will be taught.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'title'}>Mok Yan Jong "Wooden Man Form"</Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      The famous Ving Tsun "Wooden Dummy" Form.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      Historically this form has been expanded and contracted by various
      masters. The version we play is the one handed down by Yip Man (seen here
      to the left) it contains 108 movements in 8 sections.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      The main purpose of this form is to train your "Yee" or intent/will while
      maintaining appropriate positioning and structure. It is not a substitute
      for a live partner rather a training tool to focus on detailed aspects of
      the system.
    </Typography>
    <Typography type={'body'}>
      Without the foundation provided by the hand forms and the principles they
      contain, one cannot understand the nature of the Wooden Dummy.
    </Typography>
