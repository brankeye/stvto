It is not invented, it is handed down, when\n      selecting a Kung Fu ALWAYS trace the lineage of the teacher.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>\n      Why do you spell \"Wing Chun\" as \"Ving Tsun\"?\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      Ving Tsun is the \"older\" spelling of Wing Chun, it denotes that we come\n      from the more traditional Moy Yat Lineage. The pronunciation is the same,\n      though not as well marketed ;)\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>What do you mean by traditional?</Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      Simply put we teach the system as it was laid out by our grand master and\n      we follow a \"traditional\" system of etiquette, which among other things\n      solves common problems that arise in martial arts clubs. We are\n      disinterested in \"martial fads\" our focus is on the roots of our system\n      and the wisdom within it to bring about a \"Kung Fu Life\".\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>\n      Do I need prior martial arts training?\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      No, alot of people come to Ving Tsun after spending years in other styles\n      but it is not required.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>Do you teach children?</Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      As a rule, no. Classes are 2 hours long and the system requires alot of\n      repetition. Children generally don't have the attention span, maturity, or\n      the long term interest required to internalize the system. As a rule we\n      accept students over 14 years of age.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>How often should I train?</Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      My Si Hing (Older Kung Fu Brother) once summed it like this (I'll\n      paraphrase for him any inaccuracy is mine): \"Say your destination is\n      across a large field of tall grass. The first time across you make a path.\n      Coming back immediately is easier because you simply follow the path\n      already laid out. If you wait too long between journeys you will have to\n      find your way from scratch.\" So, how long would it take for these\n      metaphorical weeds to grow on your path to hinder your progress?\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>How does grading work?</Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      Well, there is a tough answer here. If you are not ready, you won't be\n      graded, Sifu WILL NOT promote anyone who is not ready. If you are ready,\n      you will be approached and asked to prepare for the test. It's not a kung\n      fu fortune cookie parable about patience, we just don't like people\n      wearing sashes they don't deserve and neither should they.\n    </Typography>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default FAQ;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
