You cannot\n      separate or dissect it. Thinking \"oh the wooden dummy looks cool\" or\n      \"those swords look fierce.\" and learning only that piece without the\n      context the system provides will leave you only \"wearing the model's\n      clothes.\"\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      We don't promote memorization of techniques and principles. We use\n      repetition to re-tune your reflexes. The system is simple and easily\n      digestible. It is laid out methodically with each step laying the\n      foundation for the next.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      Here is how the system breaks down (high level view)\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'title'}>Hand forms</Typography>\n    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>Siu Lim Tao</Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      The first of the three hand forms, Siu Lim Tao is dense and fascinating.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      Essentially it's broken down into three parts. It initially assumes you\n      know nothing and patiently explains the basic vocabulary of the system.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      The first section is centered on using your body to show you correct\n      positions and structure. The second how to generate power in various\n      directions and lastly putting them together properly.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      The lessons are given to you methodically; first you learn proper stance,\n      how to “draw your centerline”, how to punch, make a fist and so on.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      As you progress through the system you will come to see this form in many\n      different lights.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>Chum Kiu \"Searching the Bridge\"</Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      One cannot understand the nature of Chum Kiu without first learning the\n      basics offered in Siu Lim Tao.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      Once you have learn those basics from a stationary position it is time to\n      apply them while moving and interacting with another person.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      The focus here is on finding the \"connection point\" or bridge between you\n      and your target, to do so offensively while maintaining defensive\n      advantages.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>Biu Jee \"Shooting Fingers\"</Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      In my experience this is the most misunderstood form in the system. Some\n      believe it contains movements so dangerous that to use them would\n      instantly kill your opponent and their whole family ;).\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      This is not how we view this form. Once again understanding a form in Ving\n      Tsun you must take the others into account.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      In Siu Lim Tao you have learn proper position, structure, how to throw\n      power and technique. Then you learn in Chum Kiu how to do this while\n      moving and dealing with another person. What’s left? We should be done\n      right? Not quite.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      The question now becomes, what happens when things go wrong? When you lose\n      position, misstep or have your “structure” compromised. Essentially Biu\n      Jee covers the \"Emergency Techniques” used to recapture what we would call\n      optimal position. This form concludes the three hand forms.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'title'}>Weapon Forms</Typography>\n    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>\n      Luk Dim Poon Kwan \"6 1/2 Point Pole\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'quote'}>\n      “Luk Dim Poon Kwan, like other elements of Ving Tsun, needs to be studied\n      completely and for its own sake, not as a means to some other end.”\n      <br />– Grandmaster Moy Yat\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      The 6 1/2 Point Pole refers to the number of techniques in the form. This\n      form is used to train power, horse, centreline and provide a deeper view\n      of the systems principles.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'subtitle'}>Pah Chum Dao \"8 Slicing Knives\"</Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      The Bah Cham Dao are two short broad-bladed swords. Generally not part of\n      the official curriculum, this form was traditionally withheld from\n      students at the Sifu's discretion.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      The repetitions in this form are counted at 4 instead of the customary 3.\n      This reminds us that the movements in the Bah Chum Dao deal death with\n      every movement. The number 4 in Chinese Culture is synonymous with death.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      Bah Cham Dao is used these days to train punching power, \"fierceness\" and\n      footwork.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      Formal teaching of this form is not officially part of the system. When\n      you are \"ready\" you will be taught.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'title'}>Mok Yan Jong \"Wooden Man Form\"</Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      The famous Ving Tsun \"Wooden Dummy\" Form.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      Historically this form has been expanded and contracted by various\n      masters. The version we play is the one handed down by Yip Man (seen here\n      to the left) it contains 108 movements in 8 sections.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      The main purpose of this form is to train your \"Yee\" or intent/will while\n      maintaining appropriate positioning and structure. It is not a substitute\n      for a live partner rather a training tool to focus on detailed aspects of\n      the system.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography type={'body'}>\n      Without the foundation provided by the hand forms and the principles they\n      contain, one cannot understand the nature of the Wooden Dummy.\n    </Typography>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default System;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
